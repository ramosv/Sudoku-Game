# Sudoku-Game built from scratch in python
* On going project to develop a Sudoku Game solver that uses machine learning to solve any Sudoku game
* Developed an algorithm to detect if a given sudoku game board is legal and solvable.
* Built a model that can solve sudoku puzzles with low accuracy.
* Next step is try different models and compare their accuracy with the existing baseline
